🚀 Full CI/CD Pipeline Project for Node.js Applications
This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a Node.js application. By leveraging GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS EC2, we create a seamless pipeline that simplifies development workflows and ensures reliable deployments.

🌟 Key Features
Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
Containerization with Docker
Intelligent semantic versioning for consistent releases
Multi-platform Docker image builds for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
Hassle-free deployment to AWS EC2 instances
Built-in health monitoring for Docker containers
Docker layer caching to optimize builds
Secure management of sensitive information via GitHub Secrets
Automatic resource cleanup for efficient CI/CD processes
🛠️ Before You Begin
Prerequisites
To fully enjoy this project, ensure the following are set up:

Node.js (v18 or newer)
Docker installed on your machine
GitHub account for the repository
Docker Hub account for storing container images
AWS EC2 instance to host your application
Git for version control
🔑 Configuration
GitHub Secrets Setup
To unlock the magic of automation, configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username


DOCKER_PASSWORD: Docker Hub password or personal access token
AWS_SSH_KEY: SSH private key for accessing your EC2 instance
AWS_HOST: IP address or hostname of the EC2 instance
DEPLOY_PORT: Port to expose your application
🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
🕹️ Triggers
The pipeline kicks into action on:

Commits pushed to the main branch
Pull requests targeting the main branch
✨ Steps
Code Checkout
Pulls the repository code.
Performs an efficient shallow clone for faster operations.
Automated Version Management
Updates the application version with every release.
Tags the repository with the updated version.
Pushes the tags back to GitHub for tracking.
Docker Build and Push
Configures Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds.
Authenticates with Docker Hub using secure credentials.
Builds lightweight Docker images for your application.
Pushes the images to Docker Hub for deployment.
Deploy to AWS EC2
Establishes secure SSH access to your EC2 instance.
Pulls the latest Docker image from Docker Hub.
Manages the container lifecycle:
Stops and removes the old container.
Starts the new container.
Performs health checks to verify deployment success.
Implements automatic rollback if health checks fail.
Automated Cleanup
Deletes temporary SSH artifacts for security.
Clears unused Docker layers to save resources.
🐳 Docker Configuration
Optimized Dockerfile
Base Image: node:18-alpine for a lightweight build
Exposed Port: 3000
Resource Limits:
Memory: 512MB
CPU: 0.5 cores
Health Check: Monitored every 30 seconds
🌐 Application Overview
Features
A simple yet robust Express.js application.

Endpoints
/: Responds with "Hello, King Memo!"
/health: Provides real-time server health status.
🔒 Security Highlights
GitHub Secrets: Protects sensitive information like Docker Hub credentials and SSH keys.
Non-Root Containers: Runs the app with reduced privileges for added security.
Automated Updates: Keeps base images and dependencies current.
📦 Deployment
Workflow
Trigger: Automatically triggered on a push to the main branch.
Steps:
Builds and pushes a new Docker image.
Deploys the updated container to your AWS EC2 instance.
🔍 Monitoring
Container Health
Health Check Frequency: Every 30 seconds
Timeout: 10 seconds per check
Retry Policy: 3 failed attempts trigger auto-restart
🤝 Contributing
Steps to Contribute
Fork the Repository: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
Create a Feature Branch: Name your branch descriptively to reflect the changes.
Commit Changes: Make your changes and use clear, descriptive commit messages.
Push Your Branch: Push the feature branch to your forked repo.
Submit a Pull Request: Open a PR and explain your contributions clearly.
🎉 Final Thoughts
This pipeline isn’t just about automation—it’s about empowering developers and simplifying workflows. With every push, your application evolves with confidence, reliability, and speed. Let’s transform the way you deliver software!
